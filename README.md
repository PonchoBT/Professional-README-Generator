## Description
The **Professional-README-Generator** is a tool designed to solve a common problem in software development: the creation of sloppy or incomplete README files. Many developers skip the README due to laziness, lack of knowledge about Markdown syntax, or uncertainty about what information to include. This README generator addresses these issues by allowing the user to answer a series of specific questions, after which it automatically generates a professional and complete README.

## Installation
To install this tool, the user must download a zip file from the repository link provided (although the link is not included in the text), and unzip or clone it to a directory of their choice. Next, you need to open the file in a code editor like VS Code, make sure you're in the root directory of the project, and be ready to run the application.

## Usage
Once the installation is complete, the user needs to run `node index.js` in the terminal. Then, you must answer the questions presented to you. Upon completion, the application will generate a README file in the `dist` folder with the name `generatedREADME`, which will be formatted in Markdown syntax. This facilitates its direct integration into the user's project.
